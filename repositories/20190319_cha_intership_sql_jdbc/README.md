<p align="left">The challenge was to integrate java with a relational database for a movie rental system that would allow users to rent movies. The main tasks of the challenge were: to assembling the infrastructure to connect the JDK (Java Development Kit) with PostgreSQL using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and therefore coding the entire layer of DAO (Data Access Object). To be solved just in 5 hours.</p>
<!-- results -->
<!-- just results, no objectives or opinions -->
<p align="left">For me it was a double challenge, because I had never connected to a database and was been programming in java for only six months. It was difficult and I had a lot of trouble to solve in the SQL (Standard Query Language) queries of relational tables containing foreign key. I couldn't finish it. And the PariPassu team didn't consider me as a possible intern.</p>
<!-- conclusion -->
<!-- just opinions, no objectives or results -->
<p align="left">With this I learned a lot, it was hours of intense learning. From here I understood how the database connection worked. And I had no more problems configuring the infrastructure to integrate the code with the database. And a lot of future works benefited from this experience.</p>
