<p align="left">The NLW is a week of immersion in the React framework offered by the Rocketseat school. It is an event that takes place a few times a year and usually precedes the school's enrollment periods. Each event has a theme that determines the application developed. In this version of the event, the theme was social assistance and the application aimed to register shelters on a map. The application was developed in REST architecture so that the API was consumed by a web and a mobile frontend.</p>

<p align="left">The backend was developed in JavaScript with ExpressJs. The frontend was developed with React, the mobile version with REACT Native and EXPO.</p> 
<!-- conclusion -->
<!-- just opinions, no objectives or results -->
<p align="left">In this process I had my first experience developing a javascript backend with ExpressJs, allowing me to understand the counterpoints that this technology makes with Java and Python. Also the first time I made a REST backend to be distributed in web and mobile frontends, so I could see the power of this systems architecture. It was also the first time that I worked with geolocation and maps applications.</p>
