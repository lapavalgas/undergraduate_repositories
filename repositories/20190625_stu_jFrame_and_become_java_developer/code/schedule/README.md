# Planner

## This project was an effort to program an app using all my prior knowledge. So, here I try to organize principles of OOP (_Object-Oriented Programming_), SQL (_Structured Query Language_) Database connection with JDBC (_Java Database Connectivity_) and a user interface with Java Swing. It was written in first semester of 2019.

The app just works to keep notes as a planner and every note can have a title. Was programmed to keep the user notes private. So, here is possible to register a user and follow the login to access the app.
