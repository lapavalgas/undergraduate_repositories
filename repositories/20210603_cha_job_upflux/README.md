<!-- conclusion -->
<!-- just opinions, no objectives or results -->
<p align="left">In the time available it was only possible to complete the backend, I developed a REST API in java spring. But I believe there was a bad time management, as I did all the error and exception handling and that was not part of the requirements. So I sacrificed the unit tests and frontend. If I had time, I would have developed the frontend in Angular and Bootstrap. The biggest challenge of this selection process was the short time to develop this small system. UpFlux company did not consider me as a possible employee.</p>
