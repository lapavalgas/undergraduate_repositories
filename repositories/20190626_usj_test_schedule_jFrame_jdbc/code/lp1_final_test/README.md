## This project was 

This project was my last test in the programming language 1 class. So, the test was to create an application with jFrame that's work as a frontend to a remote database, the rules are to create a shopping list system using OOP principles (_Object-Oriented Programming_), SQL (_Structured Query Language_) Database connection with JDBC (_Java Database Connectivity_) and a user interface with Java Swing. It was written in first semester of 2019.

```

The app just works to create a list of products to shopping. So, here is possible to register, organize and remove words in a list. You can display the jFrame, but you can't login the database.
