<p align="left">In the mobile development class, teacher launched the challenge to develop a game using a framework called EnchantJs. No other requirements were requested.</p>
<!-- results -->
<!-- just results, no objectives or opinions -->
<p align="left">I studied for a while how the framework works and analyzed some open-source games to understand how this framework was used. I decided to create a game about a pizza maker preparing pizzas. The game mechanics were adapted from another game, in the base game the player controlled a dolphin and had to dodge rocks in the middle of the way, in my game, the player controls a pizza maker who must collect pizzas.</p>
<!-- conclusion -->
<!-- just opinions, no objectives or results -->
<p align="left">This challenge was one of the most interesting of the entire undergraduate course. Who has never thought of developing a game? So, despite being an experiment with a small and discontinued framework, it was a lot of fun having to think about the theme and code the game.</p>
